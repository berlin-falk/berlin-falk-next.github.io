					<h3>Summer week for families</h3>
					<p>As a closing of the week, where families worked with art at CC, we held a vernissage at the community house in Vermundsgade, Nørrebro. The exhibition was highly inspired by the works from <em>In Focus: Statements</em>, consisting of flags, banners and posters.</p>

						<p><strong>CC Studio is synonymous with CC’s strategy for presentation and learning. CC Studio is both a physical location at CC and a term defining the way we think and practise learning throughout the art centre. We use the word ’studio’ because it means ’workshop’ and refers to a place intended for study and reflection where materials can be examined and issues explored further. CC Studio is based on the first floor at CC, complete with a creative workshop, exhibition spaces, and space for immersion, learning, and relaxation. CC Studio is centred on collective activities.</strong></p>
<p>At CC, we organise exhibitions to be experienced with your whole body and from which you will hopefully gain inspiration. Art which might prompt questions, get you talking, thinking, laughing, playing, discussing, and getting to know others.</p>
<p>CC Studio designs educational materials for everyone to use as inspiration during their visit to the art centre. We put great store by dialogue and the exchange of experiences and ideas. Our exhibition hosts are always happy to chat with you about art. Just ask them.</p>
<p>Our facilities, materials, and activities are designed to allow children, young people, and adults to be together. If you’re not used to visiting exhibition venues, we’d be happy to show you some ideas on how, together, you can experience the centre and its art. Our goal is that everyone gets an opportunity to experience art in an engaging and informal way.</p>
<p>We encourage you to examine and experience the art in all manner of ways – on your own, together with someone you know, or with those you meet at the art centre. New social set-ups are formed and existing ones strengthened when we come together through creative and physical activities in the exhibitions. A fact we consider important.</p>
<h4>Guided tours for children</h4>
<p>On Saturdays and Sundays at 14.00, art educators invite children and their accompanying adults to attend guided tours for children through the exhibitions where they can examine and experience art. Focus is directed at examining the art using all faculties. The guided tour always takes its point of departure in what the children find interesting.</p>
<h4>Workshop</h4>
<p>The workshop is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 11.00–17.30 where children and adults can work with different materials together with our workshop artists. Working in the workshop is free when the admission fee has been paid. You can also book the workshop on weekdays.</p>
<h4>Temporary exhibition in hall 4</h4>
<p>Each year, we invite an acclaimed international artist to create a site-specific total installation for CC Studio – a so-called playscape which everyone can explore, play in, and examine using their bodies. The Swedish artist Jacob Dahlgren has created our first playscape, entitled <em>Art is Life</em> and you can experience it in hall 4 on the first floor.</p>
<h4>Performance, Art Bar, Culture Night, and much more</h4>
<p>In 2020, we place special focus on performance for children and young people via performance workshops, a series of performances, and separate workshops. We take part in the Culture Night event and invite you to attend the Art Bar event where children show the art and their favourite spots in the art centre to each other.</p>
<h4>Schools and institutions</h4>
<p>Art can be a unique starting point for learning and frame the context for activities, play, and dialogue, building the foundations for the formation that will ultimately turn us into active citizens. We have, therefore, designed learning programmes and courses for institutions, young families, upper secondary education, workplaces, and other groups. Both as permanent programmes, such as pictorial analysis and contemporary art, which you can book at any time –and special programmes based on current exhibitions.</p>
<p>We use dialogue-based teaching for all age groups – adults, too. Schools and institutions are welcome to visit CC on their own and can also book educational programmes. Write to us at <strong><a href="mailto:ccstudio@cphco.org">ccstudio@cphco.org</a></strong> or call <strong>+45 2989 8087.</strong></p>
<h4>CC Studio designs projects in collaboration with housing associations, institutions, festivals, and many others</h4>
<p>Together with numerous other people, we are continuously developing new ways in which to work with art, community spirit, life changes, and democracy. Centred on art, we work closely with diverse groups of children, youngsters, and adults from many walks of life in meaningful and stimulating collective action to create change and encourage a sense of community.<br />
We take part with projects and agenda items at the Folkemødet (a Danish festival for democracy and dialogue), the Folkemøde for Young People, Roskilde Festival, and the cultural event on the island of Mors, Kulturmødet.<br />
We want to make a difference to society by helping to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to take part in, experience, and access social and cultural resources.<br />
We realise that art can be a powerful platform for motivating people and stimulate ideas to take an active part in communal life. Under the heading <em>Fællesskabsprojekterne</em> <em>(Community activity projects)</em>, we want to work to empower mixed community groups in society.</p>
<p>You are most welcome to contact us with your enquiries, ideas, and suggestions for collaborative projects. Follow CC Studio’s initiatives and activities in <em>Journal</em> and in the calendar.</p>
